In phase one, you learned how to program. In phase two, you learned how the internet works. In phase three, you'll learn how to be professional developers. To do so, we'll be focusing on the following topics:

Architecting, not just building. Your job is to build codebases that are elegant, well-organized, and the result of conscious design decisions. Much of this phase will be spent discussing how to best structure your codebase on the server and on the client.

Writing maintainable code. Our focus in this phase is on maintainability â€“ this includes testing, of course, but also readability, documentation, version control, and system design. In three weeks, you will sell yourself as someone who can be trusted to write production code. Your job in this phase is to make that a reality.

Learning with intention. When you graduate, your value isn't what you know. Its how you learn. Can you learn new tools quickly, and utilize them well? These are the behaviors of great developers, and you should start practicing them now.

I've already posted the phase 3 guide. Before Wednesday, you should tackle the following challenges:

Build a Rails Blog. An exercise in building a simple Rails app. This is a must.
Intro to Rails Reading. A comprehensive walkthrough of all the moving parts in Rails.
Testing in Rails. A chance to write some controller, model, and feature tests in Rails. Do enough until you feel comfortable with testing syntax.
Self-Assessment. Steven's 'quiz' he gives to incoming phase 3 students. If you can complete 75% of it, you are in good shape.
I've also altered the curriculum, freeing up room for you all to learn new things and follow your passions. You'll be doing so through the lens of thunder talks. I'll explain more on Monday, but be sure to look over the repository and get a feel for the different topics. Do them right, and your cohort will push the boundaries of what's possible for final projects.

Welcome to phase three. See you on Monday.
