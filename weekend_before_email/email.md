Welcome to Phase III

Hello, welcome to Phase III. This phase is where it all comes together and we
reach new heights — together. I’m $TEACHER and I will be your phase lead teacher.

The New

Every time I approach teaching I try to do it anew: new ideas, new approaches,
new topics. As a result I have had to push more things down into phase 2
so that we can have new, more interesting discussions in phase 3.

Consequently, I want to gloss over some discussions in favor of having room for
new things. Therefore I need you to be solid on the following concepts before
Monday. You should be strong on them already, but if you are not, take this
weekend as an opportunity to get set.

Testing

I want you to know how to do testing: syntax locked-in for sure, but feel free
to leave room for us to discuss testing approaches and goals of testing. I want
this phase to have room to discuss TDD meaningfully versus discussing RSpec
syntax (as you will no doubt be asked to do in interviews).

If you have any questions, or if you have any syntax issues you want to lock in
over this weekend I want you to buy Everyday Rails: RSpec.  I have negotiated
with the author to let you buy a copy of this book for less than the price of a
Sushirrito. Here’s a coupon-code backed link:

[http://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec/c/devbootcamp

He did a great work explaining a complex ecosystem of tools. It’s worth double
the price and he’s giving you guys a 33% markdown.

REST

I assume you’re masters of REST at this point. I assume that if I give you a
“resource,” a “thing” that your site manages, you will know that GET /things/
does something different than POST /things, etc. If you have any questions
on this please consult:

http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#crud-verbs-and-actions

ActiveRecord

ActiveRecord is so much more than a simple ORM abstraction for talking to a
database. It’s also a better query interface, it provides you a beautiful
and elegant means for creating across associations. The most-wise of you will
read the following in its entirety.

http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html

Take it in doses, don’t do it all in one go. Think about it, code along a few
experiments in a console, etc.

Pay particular attention to:

http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#detailed-association-reference

…and to the query interface:

http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html

ActiveRecord is not a “nice way to type up a bunch of SQL with question marks
injected into it.” ActiveRecord has better facilities for making such queries
and I expect you to reach for them.

Object-Oriented JavaScript

Before I came to DBC I was maintaining a gigantic JavaScript application with a number of custom features that was built on Ember. I want to share these experiences with you.

Consequently, I need you to be very clear on:

How to create a class (constructor function + prototype)
How to perform an AJAX query (using jQuery is fine) using the jQuery
promises (i.e. done(), then()) interface.
JavaScript testing: install Jasmine Standalone (refer to your orange-trees
challenge and use it to test a simple class e.g. Greeter)
MVC

You might be saying: “But Steven, I get MVC, I’ve done MVC in every phase.”

Odds are that you’ve mastered a few patterns and are rinse / wash / repeating
(or maybe not! I hope to be surprised). MVC is not about file names or
directory paths. MVC is a real-world phenomenon that we’ve dissolved into
code. Make sure you can think abstractly about this, uh, abstraction.

Object Orientation

I want to show you amazing Object-orientation in every level of the stack:
Ruby, Rails, JavaScript.

I want you to know how to craft a beautiful orchestra of objects. It would not
be foolish to spend some time re-reading Practical Object-Oriented Design in
Ruby by Metz. People often ask “Where’s POODR for JavaScript?” The answer is
that the POODR for JavaScript is POODR! While your sense of this will continue
to grow, learning to see the Tao behind all proper Object-Orientation is
something you should be waxing strong in.

Conclusion

I am very excited to teach this cohort. I hope we will travel to unseen
territories together.  If you have questions around this, feel free to reply.

Best, $TEACHER
