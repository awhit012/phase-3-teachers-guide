* what do you think about CSS?
  - its not crazy! its a language with rules!
  - all web developers have to do a little bit of CSS. this is something you'll be using for your entire career.
  - i really enjoy CSS. well not enjoy, but like that its different. ruby, python, js, php, are all kind of the same language. they have their quirks, but the context shift isn't crazy. CSS is a whole different way to think.
  - You can ignore it, say "I'm a back-end programmer", a lot of people do. Hell, you can get a job at oracle tomorrow and code in the same language for the next 30 years. Totally valid. But I personally enjoy working in different contexts, as I think that diversity gives me unique insights into problems. It's the same reason I love DBC -- students come from weird backgrounds, I was a journalist, math teacher, marketing, chef, theatre. We have a unique perspective to bring to the field. In the same way, you are strengthened by the number of contexts you are in.

* feedback loops. when you're working with an unfamiliar tool.
  - build --> run --> output --> adjust
  - at first your loops we're very short. What's an each statement? how do variables work? over time your loops got longer. you understand more, so you can set up more complex testing situations. I don't understand with .inject does, but I understand .each, and let me play with that for a while to glean some insight. You also, you know to stop and think about the problem for a while.
  - its any jump to make to assume that your loops will get longer as you mature in this industry. Which is somewhat true. But I'd suggest that the model is slightly off. The senior engineers I know have loops that look something like this: short and long.
  - sometimes you need to just try stuff to see if it works, and get a lot of feedback. Sometimes you have no idea what's going on, and you step away from the computer, go read.
  - you're buiding this already with ruby and rails.
  - why does this matter: my guess is that with css, you don't have a long feedback loop.

  - much of your confusion has to do with positioning:
    display, position, visibility, float.
