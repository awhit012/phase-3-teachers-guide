## Welcome

- reworking phase 3. Based around the following: what are the habits of successful DBC grads?
  - they have the habits of professional developers. They can write tests, they have good commits, they work well in a team. They are polished. This phase is about giving you that polish.
  - They can have intelligent conversations about tools. Not "I CAN BUILT AN APP WITH RAILS, JQUERY, BOOTSTRAP, SASS, AND COFFEESCRIPT IN 30 MINUTES." That may be impressive to non-technical recruiters, but real programmers will not be impressed. You should be able to talk about the pros and cons of each tool, and why you might choose to use it.
  - They can learn quickly, and on their own. They aren't scared of new concepts, and they are comfortable with being uncomfortable. They are empowered by confusion, not paralyzed but it.


- logistics:
  - you have the challenges already. I expect intro to rails, testing rails, and build a blog to be done by wednesday morning. If you're done, there's lots of reading to do.
  - Wednesday through Friday is the stack overflow worskhop. This is about rails, but more about being a professional programming. I expect you'll have a basic understanding of Rails and testing syntax, so we can have more interesting discussions about TDD and Rails Design patterns.
  - Thunder talks. I've created 13 topics that recent grads often focus on. n groups of 2 or 3, you're going to research these. The goal is to allow you all to follow your interests and passions, while also increasing the aggregate knowledge of the cohort. Come final projects, your cohort is going to have more experience with advanced concepts and tools than any cohort before you.
    - The last cohort did these, but I'm made two alterations:
      - one, I'm loosened the 9-6 curriculum, so you can spend your evenings and weekend diving into these. These topics are just as important as your rails education, I want to give you time to play with them. This is an experiment, and this is the part I'm most worried about. It's week 7, and it will be easy for yo, start reintegrating into the real world (start looking at jobs, going to meetups, working your connections, etc. ) Do   n't. You have the rest of your life to do that shit. Put in your 100% these next three weeks and it will pay off for a long time.
      - and 2, I've drastically increased the scope and difficulty of these projects. Someone is going to learn firebase. Someone is going to learn a JS framework. Someone is going to build an IOS app. These are topics we've never asked DBC students to learn before. I try not to get excited
    - I'm not sure how assignment should work. I thought I'd let you guys decide.
  - Oh, I've made one more change -- I'm trying to drastically scale down the amount of lectures. I'll be on the floor, and we'll have an intro to rails architecture tomorrow morning. That's all I have today.
