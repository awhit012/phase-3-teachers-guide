- pretend your PM came to you and said: let's do this polymorphically. what do you do? ASK!

- [EXPLAIN POLYMORPHISM]
  - its a relatively complex design pattern for a database, that exchanges the speed of certain types of queries for a more extendable schema. maps oo duck typing to db design.
  - diagram.

- cool. now what? learn more!
  - read. google. experts. ask people.
  - think about implementation
    - how do I model this in a database?
    - how does to map to active record?
    - how do I map this to my rails architecture?
    - how do I implement it in rails?
  - these are design decisions. They do not have to happen now, but you're keyboard will not necessarily help you.

- from yesterday:
  - LEARN
  - BUILD
  - ENSURE
  - DOCUMENT
- TDD takes care of the last three, but its not particularly good for learning. instead, spike!

- polymorphism isn't important. What's important is that you learn a complex topic, and make conscious, intelligent decisions on how to implement it in rails.
